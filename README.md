# Notes

## Install and Setup

`npm install cypress`

`git tag install`

`git push origin install`

You can now open Cypress by running:

`node_modules/.bin/cypress open`

When the above command is run for the first time, Cypress adds folders with example tests and fixtures.

`git tag setup-complete; git push origin setup-complete`
